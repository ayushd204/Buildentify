# Buildentify
An image classification CNN model that identifies the buildings of the Mississippi State Campus -- part of the AI_club challenge!

Project Overview

The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model that classifies images of buildings at Mississippi State University. Using a ResNet-50 architecture, the model predicts which building is shown in a given image. The project implements image data augmentation and mixed-precision training to optimize performance on limited computational resources.

Folder Structure

    dataset/MergeDataset_pt: Contains the images of buildings saved as PyTorch tensors used for training the model.
    dataset/test: Contains the images of buildings for the test split, they can be png or jpeg.
    output/: Stores the trained model checkpoints and training metrics, such as loss plots.
    utils/: Contains all the scripts.

Files

    train.py: Contains functions to train the model using data augmentations and optimized settings for the available hardware.
    eval.py: Provides functions to evaluate the trained model, calculate performance metrics, and output results.
    convert_to_pt.py: Converts png images into pytorch tensors and saves them in an identically structured folder/subfolders.
    run_prediction_on_single_image.py: Simple script to run the model on a few images used for manual testing.
    train_test_split.py: Split the dataset into train and test.
    heic_to_png.py: Convert HEIC image format used by ios to png.
    extract_frames.py: Extract individual frames from a mov file.

Instructions
1. Requirements

Ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

torch torchvision scikit-learn matplotlib

2. Training the Model
Model Architecture

    Base Architecture: ResNet-50, a deep CNN model pre-trained on ImageNet, is fine-tuned for this classification task.
    Final Layer: The fully connected (FC) layer is modified to predict 10 classes, each representing a unique building.

Training Steps

    Pre-trained Model Initialization: The ResNet-50 model is initialized with pre-trained weights, and the final layer is adjusted for 10 classes.
    Data Augmentation: The dataset undergoes transformations to improve model robustness:
        Random resized cropping, horizontal flipping, and rotation.
        Color jitter, Gaussian blur, and additive Gaussian noise for realistic variations.
    Mixed Precision Training: torch.cuda.amp.autocast is used to accelerate training without compromising accuracy.
    Training:
        Run train.py to start training.
        The script saves the best-performing model based on loss reduction.
        Loss plot updates each epoch and is saved in the output/ directory.

Running Training

Run the train.py script as follows:

python train.py

Configure model and dataset paths within train_model() in train.py if needed.

3. Evaluating the Model
Evaluation Metrics

The evaluation metrics include:

    Accuracy: Measures overall classification correctness.
    F1 Score: Weighted average of precision and recall, accounting for class imbalance.
    Confusion Matrix: Displays true positives, false positives, and other metrics per class.
    Classification Report: Includes precision, recall, and F1 scores for each building class.

Running Evaluation

Close the repository, and place your folders containing images into the test folder. Read dataset/test/instructions.txt for exact info.

Run the eval.py script as follows:

python eval.py

Output

    Training Loss Plot: Saved as loss.png in the output/ folder.
    Model Checkpoints: Saved after each epoch and for the best model in output/.
    Evaluation Report: Prints the accuracy, F1 score, confusion matrix, and classification report in the console.
